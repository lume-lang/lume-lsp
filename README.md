# `lume-lsp`

lume-lsp is a language server for the [Lume](https://github.com/lume-lang/lume) programming language. You can use it with any editor that supports the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), but there are official extensions for [Zed](https://github.com/lume-lang/extension-zed).
